# Project-Description

# Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Library Management System in Python. The system allows users to add books to the library, view the library's contents, and check the number of books in the library.

# Features
- Book Addition: Users can add one or multiple books to the library using the `appendb` method.<br>
-Library Viewing: Users can view the library's contents using the `getlib` method.<br>
-Book Count: Users can check the number of books in the library using the `numberofbooks` method.<br>

# How to Use
1. Create an instance of the `Library` class.
2. Use the `appendb` method to add books to the library.
3. Use the `getlib` method to view the library's contents.
4. Use the `numberofbooks` method to check the number of books in the library.

# Code Explanation
The `Library` class has three methods:

`__init__`: Initializes the library with an empty list of books and sets the number of books to 0.
`appendb`: Adds one or multiple books to the library and updates the number of books.
`getlib`: Prints the library's contents.
`numberofbooks`: Prints the number of books in the library.
Feel free to modify or extend this code to suit your needs!
